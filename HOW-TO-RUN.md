This program will read input from a file called `input.ops`. this file contains JSON formatted acording to the definitions found in `operations.asn`.

It is essential that `main.py`, `input.ops` and `operations.asn` are in the same directory.

If an `input.ops` file is present, you can run the file `main.py`. after this file has executed a new file will be created called `output.ops`. This file contains the original input and the calculated answers.
